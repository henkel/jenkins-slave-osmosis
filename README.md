# Osmosis
Osmosis is a command line Java application for processing OSM data. The tool consists of pluggable components that can be chained to perform a larger operation. For example, it has components for reading/writing databases and files, deriving/applying changes to data sources, and sorting data, (etc.). It has been written to easily add new features without re-writing common tasks such as file and database handling.
